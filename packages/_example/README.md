## Introduction

This package serves as an example agent for Forest Admin. Its purpose is to demonstrate and test the agent's features and facilitate debugging across the entire project.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone and Install Dependencies**

   Clone the whole repository and navigate into the `agent-nodejs` directory. Run the following commands to install all dependencies and auto-link all packages:
