Custom connectors are the answer to the need to import collections from either

- Unsupported databases
- Unsupported SaaS providers
- Your own in-house APIs.

Forest Admin is built so that it does not know need the nature of the datasource it is speaking to, at long as it exposes a given interface.

That interface is only there to abstract away differences between backends so that they can be used as forest admin collections, it was built to allow for the minimal feature set which allow forest admin to work.

# Getting started

When creating a custom connector two routes can be taken:

| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| How does it work | All data from the target API/Database is copied and kept up to date on the agent server.<br><br>Then:<br>- Read operations are run in the local cache<br>- Write operations are forwarded to the target API | The connector translates all forest admin queries to the target API.                                                                                                                              |
| Preconditions    | Target API can sort records by last modification                                                                                                                                                            | Target API is capable of expressing filters, aggregating data, ...                                                                                                                                |
| Pros             | - Fast (uses sqlite under the hood)<br>-Easy to implement                                                                                                                                                   | - No disk usage<br>- No limits on quantity of data                                                                                                                                                |
| Cons             | - Slower agent start (need to synchronize all API data since last start)<br>- Disk Usage<br><br>- For some applications, quantity of data may be too large                                                  | - More difficult to implement<br>- When the feature gap between forest admin query system and the target API is large the connector would need to rely a lot on emulation which hurts performance |

## Steps

Depending on your choice between "Local Cache" or "Query Translation", creating a connector is a very different task.

Local Cache:

1. Declaring the structure of the data
2. Implement a method which loads all records changed since a provided date
3. When relevant, implement methods for record creation, update and delete.

Query Translation:

1. Declaring the structure of the data
2. Declaring the API capabilities
3. Coding a translation layer

When using the query translation route, it will be a bit longer:

## Minimal examples
