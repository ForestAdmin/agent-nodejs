Before starting, it is highly advised to read the following section:

- [Understanding Queries](../../../under-the-hood/queries/README.md)
- [Understanding Filters](../../../under-the-hood/queries/filters.md)
- [Understanding Projections](../../../under-the-hood/queries/projections.md)
- [Understanding Aggregations](../../../under-the-hood/queries/aggregations.md)
