Did you write a reusable connector to a SaaS, or to a database vendor that we don't support?
At Forest Admin, we would love to see it!

We are well-aware than Forest Admin is a commercial project, and asking for open-source contributions may seem off-limits to some.
However if you have written a connector, open-sourcing it on our repository also has advantages for you.

# How to propose a new connector

Would you consider making a [pull request](https://github.com/ForestAdmin/agent-nodejs/pulls) and merging your connector into Forest Admin for other customers to use it?

## Conditions

When proposing a new connector, reach to us and we'll work together to bring your connector to the standards that we follow.

However note that:

- We'll merge only connectors to SaaS which have enough traction (so that it is likely that other customers than you will use them)
- You must use TypeScript
- Translating connectors are prefered (when implementing one is possible, depending on the target API)

## Once merged

Once connectors are merged into the agent repository, we try very hard to:

- Maintain them up-to-date on each new release of Forest Admin
- Maintain high to very-high test coverage
- Maintain public and up-to-date documentation
