In order to make forest admin useful you'll need to connect it to your data.

This is achieved by using connectors

Forest Admin collections can map to a variety of things

- Database tables (either SQL or MongoDB)
- ORM collections (Sequelize, Mongoose)
- Endpoints on supported SaaS providers (Stripe, Intercom, ...)
- Endpoints on your own API (by writing a custom connector)

Each connector is available in a different NPM package
