# Forest CLI commands

You've seen in the previous section how [developing on Forest Admin](../) leverages our powerful **Forest CLI** to manage your UI changes.

### Installing Forest CLI

To install Forest CLI, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install -g forest-cli
```

For further details on the package, check out [this page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forest-cli).

{% hint style="info" %}
`forest-cli` is different from `lumber-cli`, which is only used for generating your project.
{% endhint %}

### Using Forest CLI

In the following pages, we'll cover all available Forest CLI commands in details, from introduction to advanced usage. For now, there are 6 commands:

* [init](init.md)
* [login](login.md)
* [branch](branch.md)
* [switch](switch.md)
* [push](push.md)
* [deploy](deploy.md)

Some additional commands might be added in the future. In the meantime, those should be largely sufficient to manage your development workflow.
