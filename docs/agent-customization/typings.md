Since the Forest Admin agent is fully written in typescript, every function has autocomplete capabilities.
In order to make things easier to manipulate, then agent is also able to generate typing files depending on your models configuration.

## Generate a typing file

The typing file generated by Forest Admin will allow you to autocomplete any given fields of a collection, as well as having autocompletion on the query interface. This is an auto-generated file, so we highly suggest to not edit it manually.

In the following sections, you can see that 2 new options are given to the `createAgent` function:

- `typingsPath`: The location you want your typing file to be created.
- `typingsMaxDepth`: The maximum depth of introspection for relationships.

## Using the typing file in a typescript context

In a typescript context, usage of the typing file is pretty straightforward. You can simply import the typing file and template your `createAgent` with the schema to use it.

```typescript
import { createAgent } from '@forestadmin/agent';
import Schema from './src/forest/typing';

(async () => {
  await createAgent<Schema>({
    authSecret: process.env.FOREST_AUTH_SECRET,
    agentUrl: process.env.FOREST_AGENT_URL,
    envSecret: process.env.FOREST_ENV_SECRET,
    isProduction: false,
    typingsPath: './typings.ts',
    typingsMaxDepth: 5,
  })
    .customizeCollection('transactions', transactions => transactions.removeField('amountInEur'))
    .mountOnStandaloneServer(3000)
    .start();
})();
```

You should be able to see that the `customizeCollection` is strongly typed, as well the `transactions` handler.

## Using the typing file in a javascript context

Even though the autocompletion will not be as good as it could be in Typescript, you can still benefit from it in a Javascript environment by using the JSDoc syntax.

Using the mentionned syntax presented above in a Javascript context would look like this.

```javascript
(async () => {
  /**
   * @type {import('@forestadmin/agent').Agent<import('./typings').Schema>}
   */
  const agent = createAgent({
    authSecret: process.env.FOREST_AUTH_SECRET,
    agentUrl: process.env.FOREST_AGENT_URL,
    envSecret: process.env.FOREST_ENV_SECRET,
    isProduction: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
    typingsMaxDepth: 5,
    typingsPath: './typings.ts',
  });

  await agent.mountOnStandaloneServer(3000).start();
})();
```

If you choose to split your `customizeCollection` handler in a dedicated file (That's the project scaffolding we usually use at Forest Admin), you can use the following JSDoc example to keep the typing experience intact.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {import('@forestadmin/agent').Collection<import('./typings').Schema, 'transactions'>} transactions
 */
module.exports = transactions => {
  transactions.removeField('amountInEur'); // Autocompletion should be available fully on this line
};
```
