Forest Admin user interface is designed with flat tables in mind. This paradigm may not be the best fit for your data model if you are using a NoSQL database with nested documents.

In this case, you can use the provided flattener plugin to flatten your data model before sending it to Forest Admin.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @forestadmin/plugin-flattener
```

## Usage

Two methods are available to flatten your data model: `flattenColumn` and `flattenRelation`.

### `flattenColumn`

This method allows you to flatten deeply nested columns of your models.

Note that when using this method, the collection won't be filterable nor sortable by this column.

```javascript
const { flattenColumn } = require('@forestadmin/plugin-flattener');

agent.customizeCollection('customer', collection => {
  collection.use(flattenColumn, {
    // Name of the column to flatten into the root model
    columnName: 'address',

    // Subfields to flatten (defaults to all subfields up to the `level` setting)
    include: ['street', 'city', 'country:name', 'country:isoCode'],

    // Subfields to exclude from flattening (defaults to none)
    exclude: [],

    // When flattening a subfield, the plugin will flatten all subfields up to the `level` setting.
    // Defaults to 1 and is ignored if `include` is specified.
    level: 1,

    // Either if the newly created columns should be readonly or not (defaults to false)
    readonly: true,
  });
});
```

### `flattenRelation`

This method allows you to import fields from a given [one-to-one](../../../agent-customization/relationships/single-record.md#one-to-one-relations) or [many-to-one](../../../agent-customization/relationships/single-record.md#many-to-one-relations) relations.

It is useful when you want to repatriate multiple fields inside one collection.

```javascript
const { flattenRelation } = require('@forestadmin/plugin-flattener');

agent.customizeCollection('customer', collection => {
  return collection.use(flattenRelation, {
    relationName: 'address',

    // Subfields to flatten (defaults to all subfields of the relation)
    include: ['street', 'city', 'country:name', 'country:isoCode'],

    // Subfields to exclude from flattening (defaults to an empty array)
    exclude: [],

    // Either if the newly created columns should be readonly or not (defaults to false)
    readonly: true,
  });
});
```

Note that nested relations are supported using the `:` separator.

```javascript
const { flattenRelation } = require('@forestadmin/plugin-flattener');

agent.customizeCollection('customer', collection => {
  return collection.use(flattenRelation, { relationName: 'address:country' });
});
```
