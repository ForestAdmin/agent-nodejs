## What is an Action?

Sooner or later, you will need to perform actions on your data that are specific to your business. Moderating comments, generating an invoice, logging into a customerâ€™s account or banning a user are exactly the kind of important tasks to unlock in order to manage your day-to-day operations.
On our Live Demo example, our companies collection has many examples of Action. The simplest one is "Mark as live".

## Creating an Action

In order to create an action, you will first need to declare it in your code for a specific collection. Here we declare a Mark as Live action for the companies collection.

```javascript
agent.customizeCollection('companies', collection =>
  collection.registerAction('Mark as live', {
    scope: ActionScope.Single,
    execute: async (context, responseBuilder) => {
      return responseBuilder.success(`Company is now live!`);
    },
  }),
);
```

After declaring it, your action will appear in the "Smart actions" tab within your collection settings.

{% hint style='error' %}

An action is displayed in the UI only if:

- it is set as "visible" (see screenshot below)
  AND
- in non-development environments, the user's role must grant the "trigger" permission

{% endhint %}

You must make the action visible there if you wish users to be able to see it.

It will then show in the actions dropdown button:

{% hint style='info' %}

At this point, the action only displays a notification, because no business logic is present.

{% endhint %}

The action behavior is implemented in the `execute` function.
In the following example, we've implemented the behavior for the Mark as live Action, which simply changes a company's status to live.

```javascript
agent.collection('companies', collection =>
  collection.registerAction('Mark as live', {
    scope: ActionScope.Single,
    execute: async (context, responseBuilder) => {
      await context.collection.update(context.filter, { status: 'live' });
      return responseBuilder.success(`Company is now live!`);
    },
  }),
);
```
