Customization refers to a series of actions that enable you to personalize your agent, data source, or collection.

An agent is an HTTP server that serves the Forest Admin front-end application.
A data source is a database or an API that you want to connect to Forest Admin.
A collection is a set of data that you want to manage in Forest Admin.

You have the option to modify your agent by incorporating data sources, utilizing plugins, customizing collections, and charts that will be displayed in the dashboard.
Additionally, you can personalize your data sources by offering choices that cater to all data source types.
Lastly, you can adapt your collections by including fields, actions, segments, relations between the data sources and other functionalities.
