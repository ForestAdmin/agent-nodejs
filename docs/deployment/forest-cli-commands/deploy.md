### Deploying your changes

It is paramount to understand this command before using it:

![](<../../assets/image (425).png>)

As you can see in the above figure, the layout changes (Δ) located in your local branch `my-branch` will be **irreversibly applied** to your Production layout. Since your remotes' layout are based on your production's layout, the changes will appear there too.

To deploy, simply run `forest deploy`:

```
$ forest deploy
? Select the environment containing the layout changes you want to deploy to production (Use arrow keys)
❯ Development | marcperrin-pelletier
Staging 1
Staging 2
```

### Deploy from the UI

This is possible **only from a remote** environment:

![](<../../assets/image (426).png>)

To deploy your latest layout changes from a remote environment, you may use the **top banner link**: "Deploy to production".
