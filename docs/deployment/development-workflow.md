# Developing on Forest Admin

One of the goals of Forest Admin is empowering technical teams to achieve more in less time: in other words, giving them the means to create and maintain a great admin panel in as little time as possible.

### Development tools

Your Forest Admin panel is composed of 2 parts - [the frontend (UI) and the backend](../) - and for each one you need the right tools:

The **Admin** **backend** is part of your codebase. As a result, you'll be using your own favorite tools to customize it:&#x20;

- Editing: your favorite IDE
- Versioning: your favorite versioning tool (git, svn, mercurial, etc)

Your **Forest Admin UI** is **not** part of your codebase: it is managed on Forest Admin servers. As a result, you depend on Forest Admin tools to customize it. Here's what we've built for you:

- Editing: use the [Layout Editor mode](https://docs.forestadmin.com/user-guide/getting-started/master-your-ui/using-the-layout-editor-mode) to intuitively manage your layout (UI)
- Versioning: use [Forest CLI](forest-cli-commands/) to seamlessly manage your layout versions

### Development workflow

For a simple and hands-on **example** of how to develop on Forest Admin according to our recommended development workflow, see [this page](../../../getting-started/development-workflow.md).

For a more complete view showcasing each possible scenario of the recommended development workflow, we've drawn the following state **diagram**:
