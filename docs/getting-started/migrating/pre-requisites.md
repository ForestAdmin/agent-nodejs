## Role system

Not completing this step will prevent you from upgrading to the latest version of the agent.

The Forest Admin role system got a complete overhaul in February 2021.

If your project was created before that date, you will need to migrate your role system to the new one before you can upgrade to the latest version of the agent.

A [migration guide](https://docs.forestadmin.com/documentation/v/latest/how-tos/maintain/migrate-to-the-new-role-system) is available in the documentation of the legacy agents.
