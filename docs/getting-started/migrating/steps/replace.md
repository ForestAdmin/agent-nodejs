This is done by stopping the old agent and changing the configuration of your new agent so that all settings match with the old one (`URL prefix`, `port`, `envSecret` and `authSecret`).

Your project will then be migrated to the new agent, and you can delete both:

- The old agent code from your source tree
- The temporary project that you created.
