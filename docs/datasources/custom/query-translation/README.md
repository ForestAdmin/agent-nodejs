Implementing a data source using the "query translation" strategy is an advanced concept: you will need to have a deep understanding of forest admin internals.

This strategy is a good match when writing data sources to full featured databases.

Before starting, it is highly advised to read and understand the following section:

- [Data Model](../../../under-the-hood/data-model/README.md)
  - [Typing](../../../under-the-hood/data-model/typing.md)
  - [Relationships](../../../under-the-hood/data-model/relationships.md)
- [Query interface](../../../under-the-hood/queries/README.md)
  - [Fields and projections](../../../under-the-hood/queries/fields-projections.md)
  - [Filters](../../../under-the-hood/queries/filters.md)
  - [Aggregations](../../../under-the-hood/queries/aggregations.md)
