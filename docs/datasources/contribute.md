{% hint style="info" %}
We are well-aware than Forest Admin is a commercial project, and asking for open-source contributions may seem off-limits to some.

However if you have written a data source, open-sourcing it on our repository also has advantages for you.
{% endhint %}

Did you write a reusable data source to a SaaS, or to a database vendor that we don't support?

At Forest Admin, we would love to see it!

# How to suggest a new data source

Would you consider making a [pull request](https://github.com/ForestAdmin/agent-nodejs/pulls)?

## Conditions

When suggesting a new data source, reach to us and we'll work together to bring your data source to the standards that we follow.

However note that:

- We'll merge only data sources to SaaS which have enough traction (so that it is likely that other customers than you will use them)
- You must use TypeScript
- Translating data sources are prefered (when implementing one is possible, depending on the target API)

## Once merged

Once data sources are merged into the agent repository, we try very hard to:

- Maintain them up-to-date on each new release of Forest Admin
- Maintain high to very-high test coverage
- Maintain public and up-to-date documentation
